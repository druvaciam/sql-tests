Generate the following two result sets:
1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS,
immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses).
For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS.
Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS
and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name.
If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
